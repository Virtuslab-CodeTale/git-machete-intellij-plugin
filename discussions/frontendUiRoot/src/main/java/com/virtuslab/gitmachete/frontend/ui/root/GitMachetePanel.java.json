By code (like here) or by `plugin.xml`. \r\n\r\nReference: \r\nhttps://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/action_system.html\r\n\r\nThe refresh action is (and was) implemented here. The slide-out action requires to call it after it is done. Current implementation and (probably too strict?) relation between the panel and refresh disallow registering the refresh action via plugin.xml. That is why I used in-code registering. \r\n\r\nActually, the reregistered action issue that happened here and for the sake of consistency we could consider moving all actions to `plugin.xml`. ",
